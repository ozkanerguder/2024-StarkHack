# Yik Yak

ETH Global Link: https://ethglobal.com/showcase/undefined-kyu7d

"Yik Yak" is a decentralized SocialFi application built on the Starknet blockchain that facilitates the sharing of user-generated content under a variety of concepts, events, and phrases. Drawing inspiration from platforms such as Urban Dictionary, Ekşi Sözlük, and Reddit, Yik Yak offers a unique feature called "Yakk it," where each title undergoes an auction process and is subsequently minted as a non-fungible token (NFT).

These NFTs confer ownership rights upon their holders, who then receive a percentage of the fees generated from submissions made under their titles. This innovative approach not only incentivizes users to create and curate content but also integrates a novel economic model into the social media landscape. By recording all contributions on the blockchain, Yik Yak ensures the immutability and trustworthiness of the content.

Furthermore, titles can be traded within an internal NFT auction marketplace, providing a dynamic and fluid environment for content creation and ownership exchange. This marketplace allows users to buy, sell, and trade titles, thereby fostering an active and engaged community.

In addition to its foundational features, Yik Yak continually evolves by incorporating more ideas and expanding its lexicon, aiming to provide a comprehensive and enriching user experience. By leveraging the strengths of decentralized technology and the popularity of social media, Yik Yak positions itself as a pioneering platform in the SocialFi space.
